### **Grading Rubric for Sprint 2 (20 Points Total)**

This rubric is designed to evaluate the **Sprint 2 tasks** based on completeness, technical accuracy, and adherence to project requirements. Each section will contribute a specific number of points, totaling **20 points**, and will include criteria for thorough install/setup instructions and unit tests.

- **Criteria**:
  - [1 point] Identifies and integrates a suitable NLP API (e.g., Hugging Face, OpenAI) based on project requirements.
  - [1 point] Stores API credentials securely in environment variables and provides sample API usage code.
- **Deduction**:
  - Missing or insecure handling of API keys.
  - No evidence of testing or mock responses.

#### **Task 18**: Develop an API Endpoint to Send Data to the NLP API (2 Points)
- **Criteria**:
  - [1 point] Implements a `POST /api/analyze` endpoint that validates input data and connects to the NLP API.
  - [1 point] Handles valid and invalid responses, returning structured JSON outputs.
- **Deduction**:
  - Missing input validation or error handling.
  - Incorrect or incomplete response formatting.

#### **Task 19**: Create Standardized Input/Output Data Structures (1 Point)
- **Criteria**:
  - Defines and enforces standardized JSON structures for both input and output data.
- **Deduction**:
  - Lack of validation rules or inconsistent formats.

#### **Task 20**: Parse the API Response and Generate Fit Scores and Feedback (1 Point)
- **Criteria**:
  - Extracts `fit_score` and formats feedback clearly for frontend use.
  - Implements robust error handling for malformed API responses.
- **Deduction**:
  - Missing or incomplete parsing logic.
  - Poor handling of edge cases.

### **2. Implementing Fit Score Calculation and Feedback (6 Points)**

#### **Task 21**: Develop Algorithms for Resume-Job Comparison (2 Points)
- **Criteria**:
  - [1 point] Implements keyword matching and weighting logic to compare resume and job description content.
  - [1 point] Handles edge cases (e.g., empty or incomplete inputs).
- **Deduction**:
  - Poor accuracy of the algorithm or failure to address edge cases.

#### **Task 22**: Create Functions to Calculate Fit Scores (1 Point)
- **Criteria**:
  - Encapsulates fit score calculation logic into reusable and testable functions.
- **Deduction**:
  - Missing modularization or lack of unit tests for functions.

#### **Task 23**: Generate Feedback on Missing Skills and Sections (2 Points)
- **Criteria**:
  - [1 point] Identifies missing keywords and provides actionable feedback.
  - [1 point] Categorizes feedback into actionable sections (e.g., skills, experience).
- **Deduction**:
  - Irrelevant or incorrect feedback.
  - Missing categorization.

#### **Task 24**: Implement an API Endpoint for Fit Score and Feedback (1 Point)
- **Criteria**:
  - Implements a backend API endpoint (`POST /api/fit-score`) that integrates Tasks 21–23 and returns fit scores and feedback.
- **Deduction**:
  - Missing error handling or incomplete data validation.

### **3. Frontend Integration for Feedback Display (4 Points)**

#### **Task 25**: Build Frontend Components for Feedback Display (2 Points)
- **Criteria**:
  - [1 point] Creates a responsive dashboard displaying fit score, matched keywords, and feedback.
  - [1 point] Fetches and integrates backend data correctly.
- **Deduction**:
  - Poorly designed UI or incorrect data rendering.

#### **Task 26**: Allow Users to Download a PDF Report (1 Point)
- **Criteria**:
  - Generates and downloads a detailed PDF report with fit score, matched keywords, and feedback.
- **Deduction**:
  - Missing or incomplete PDF content.

#### **Task 27**: Add Filtering Options for Feedback Categories (1 Point)
- **Criteria**:
  - Adds functional filtering options for users to focus on specific feedback categories (e.g., skills, experience).
- **Deduction**:
  - Filters fail to update the displayed data or lack proper implementation.

  - Missing critical tests for major features.

#### **Task 29**: Perform End-to-End Testing of the Application (2 Points)
- **Criteria**:
  - [1 point] Tests all key workflows (e.g., user registration, resume upload, fit score generation).
  - [1 point] Uses automation tools (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) for consistent results.
- **Deduction**:
  - Missing test scenarios or incomplete workflow coverage.

#### **Task 30**: Write Project Documentation (1 Point)

  - Includes setup instructions (`SETUP.md`), usage guide (`README.md`), and API documentation.
  - API documentation clearly defines endpoints, request/response formats, and examples.
- **Deduction**:
  - Missing sections or unclear instructions.
